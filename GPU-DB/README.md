# Building a GPU features database

This application builds a simple database about GPUs and the features they support.
The application is capable of 2 things:
1. able to add in the name of a GPU along with the features that it supports.
2. able to choose a set of supporting features and figure out what GPUs support them.

### The GPU database generated emulates a small subset of the information found on the Vulkan GPU database.
