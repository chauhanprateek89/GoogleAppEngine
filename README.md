# GOOGLE APP ENGINE 

Few points to use these applications:
- Use Java 7 to run these applications.
- In order to generate JSP pages, GAE requires JDK. So a standard JRE cannot be used.
- The html part in the JSP pages is written in HTML5 and not all browsers may support it.
- Java variant of the google app engine is used to create these apps.
